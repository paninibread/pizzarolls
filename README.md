## Description

 An Isometric Zelda-Like Dungeon Crawler in Unity, currently a work in progress. The project aims to create an immersive gaming experience inspired by classic Zelda games, featuring isometric 3D graphics, precise melee combat mechanics, and procedurally generated dungeons.

## Frameworks Used
- Unity
- URP (Universal Render Pipeline)

## Features
1. **Animation-Based Precise Melee Combat Framework:**
   - Implements a precise melee combat system for weapons using physics raycasts for hit detection, allowing for realistic and responsive combat interactions with enemies.
2. **3D Isometric Movement with Dash:**
   - Enables players to navigate the game world in 3D isometric space, offering smooth movement controls and introducing a dash mechanic for swift traversal through dungeons and environments.
3. **Grid-Based Map Generation with Water and Inclines:**
   - Generates procedurally generated dungeons and environments using a grid-based map generation algorithm, incorporating features such as water bodies and inclines to enhance visual variety and gameplay diversity.
